My first project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)”

## 🌱 About This Project
This Snake Game represents my transition from learning programming basics on a mobile phone to implementing them on a laptop. It's a simple but complete project that helped me practice core programming concepts.

## 💻 What I Learned & Applied
### Programming Concepts Practiced:
- **Loops & Conditions** - Game flow and collision detection
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes for Snake, Food, and Game
- **Module Importing** - Organizing code into multiple files
- **Event Handling** - Keyboard controls and game events

### Technical Implementation:
- **Game Loop** - Continuous game execution and rendering
- **Collision Detection** - Snake with food and boundaries
- **Object Movement** - Smooth snake navigation
- **Score Tracking** - Real-time score updates

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pygame
- **Environment:** Mobile learning → Laptop implementation

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
